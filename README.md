# College Chatbot

Shah & Anchor Kutcchi Engineering college has an extensive website with a sea of information on different programs and courses offered. Often times, new visitors do not know where to start looking for the information they want.

Hence, we decided to create a chatbot to provide visitors with easy access to academic program details, campus maps, financial aid information, and the mountains of information housed on a website.

Moreover, when a website visitor offers their email address, a chatbot can share that information with the school’s CRM in real-time. This helps construct a knowledge base of potential students, while also updating and validating the existing data. Admissions staff will know why someone was on the website and what services or information they’re interested in learning more about. This can be used for content curation as well as email outreach to prospective students.

# Project Outcomes

In our pilot release of this chatbot, we collected various datapoints over a week such as:
1. Number of website visits
2. Website visitor demographic
3. Website pages being visited the most
4. Average session duration
5. Conversion rate
6. Bounce rate
7. Interactions per visit
8. Top traffic sources

All these data points were then reported to the school's CRM team to take actions accordingly. We also noticed a 28% jump in interactions with prospective students via this chatbot.
